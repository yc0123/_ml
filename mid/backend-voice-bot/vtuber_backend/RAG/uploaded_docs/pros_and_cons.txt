National Quemoy University has many advantages and disadvantages

Advantages: NT$2,000 transportation voucher and NT$5,000 cash are provided each semester (a small number of people do not have these), three-festival liquor rations are available if you are registered as a Kinmen citizen (you must be 20 years old and have been registered for more than 1 year), it is relatively less developed so you can see some unusual sights or creatures, there is a high chance of having a typhoon holiday, there are many classes where you drink kaoliang liquor, there are many historical sites and it is easy to find information and investigate, the courses are honestly quite unremarkable, and it is a national university with very low score requirements.

Disadvantages: You have to take a plane, so many things will be very troublesome; there is really less nightlife than other universities in Taiwan; the weather here is like the south in summer and like the north in winter; it rarely rains but during the rainy season it is not a problem for it to rain for a week or two; if you get in a serious car accident you may not be able to return home until seven days later because you have to mobilize military helicopters; many well-known chain stores are not available in Kinmen; prices seem to be on the high side.
